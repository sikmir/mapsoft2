=head1 CUSTOMIZING VIEWER INTERFACE WITH CSS STYLES

Structure of B<ms2view> window is simple: a viewer, a main menu, a
statusbar, and tables with waypoints, tracks, etc. Appearence of these
elements is controlled by GTK3 theme. One can customize it using CSS
styles. Styles are read from two places:
B</usr/share/mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- system-wide file. By default it
contains a few definitions, mostly for making interface elements smaller.
Some tips about viewer structure can be also find there.
B<$HOME/.mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- user-specific file.

Additional information about writing css styles can be found in GTK3
documentation or GTK theme sources:
