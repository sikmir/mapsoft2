=head1 CUSTOMIZING VIEWER INTERFACE WITH CSS STYLES

Structure of B<ms2view> window is simple: a viewer, a main menu, a
statusbar, tables with waypoints, tracks, and maps, a few dialogs, etc.
Appearence of these elements is controlled by GTK3 theme. One can
customize it using CSS styles. Styles are read from two places:
B</usr/share/mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- system-wide file. By default it
contains a few definitions, mostly for making interface elements smaller.
Some tips about viewer structure can be also find there.
B<$HOME/.mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- user-specific file.

Additional information about writing css styles can be found in GTK3
documentation or GTK theme sources:

=head1 CUSTOMIZING HOTKEYS

Menu hotkeys can be changed in B<$HOME/.mapsoft2/mapsoft2.acc> file.
The file is read each time the program is started and written when it
exits. A default hotkey mapping with all lines commented is written in
the first run.
