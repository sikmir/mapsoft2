=head1 CUSTOMIZING VIEWER INTERFACE WITH CSS STYLES

Structure of B<ms2view> window is simple: a viewer, a main menu, a
statusbar, tables with waypoints, tracks, and maps, a few dialogs, etc.
Appearence of these elements is controlled by GTK3 theme. One can
customize it using CSS styles. Styles are read from two places:
B</usr/share/mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- system-wide file. By default it
contains a few definitions, mostly for making interface elements smaller.
Some tips about viewer structure can be also find there.
B<$HOME/.mapsoft2/mapsoft2.css> -- user-specific file.

Additional information about writing css styles can be found in GTK3
documentation or GTK theme sources:

=head1 CUSTOMIZING HOTKEYS

Menu hotkeys can be changed in B<$HOME/.mapsoft2/mapsoft2.acc> file.
The file is read each time the program is started and written when it
exits. A default hotkey mapping with all lines commented is written in
the first run.

=head1 VIEWER PROJECTION

Mapsoft2 viewer uses the following algorithm to set viewer projection
and view area:

=over 1

=item In the beginning a web mercator projection is set, it is considered as
      "temporary" projection. Position and zoom is set to cover the whole world,
      it is considered as "temporary" view.

=item When new maps are loaded, if projection temporary, then
      it is replaced by projection of the first map and become
      non-temporary. If view is temporary, then the map is shown (view remains temporary).
      If viewer projection was non-temporary, then no projection change or zooming/scrolling is done.

=item When new tracks or points are loaded, projection does not change.
      Zoom and position of the viewer window is adjusted to have
      all loaded data on the screen. The view become non-temporary.
